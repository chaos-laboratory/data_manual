# Workflow Example 1 - Posting to Our Server with Particle Device

1. Register and setup your Particle device with our chaos lab particle account. Follow the instruction [here](https://setup.particle.io/).

2. Once your device is registered, go to the [particle web console](https://console.particle.io/devices). Check if the device is on the list.

3. Go to the [Web IDE](https://build.particle.io/build/new)

4. Go to the Devices tab, star the device that you have registered.

5. Click on the code option on the left side bar.

6. In the search bar for 'My apps' search for 'STAPI'. You will see a series of STAPIXX_XXX scripts.

7. Follow the instructions [here](https://chenkianwee.github.io/masa3db/docs/040/042particle.html) to setup your device to post to our database.

8. To check the data you can either go to our [FROST-Server](https://andlchaos300l.princeton.edu:8080/FROST-Server) or [Granfana](https://andlchaos300l.princeton.edu:3000).

9. For Grafana, follow the [Create Dashboard](https://chenkianwee.github.io/masa3db/docs/040/046grafana.html#create-dashboards) instructions to look at the data.
