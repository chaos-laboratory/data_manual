1. Get the Mac address of the particle device.

2. Install the Particle Cli [here](https://docs.particle.io/tutorials/developer-tools/cli/)

3. Type in 'particle setup' to run the cli. Then run 'particle serial mac' to get the mac address.

4. Register the device MAC address [here](https://princeton.service-now.com/service?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=27c256984f8a174018ddd48e5210c7a2&sysparm_category=0c0591f14f9d270c18ddd48e5210c79c). You need your Princeton login for this. Your phone needs to be connected to the servine net too.
