# Database Maintenance

## Backup OIT Database
1. Log on to the OIT server following sub-task {doc}`../030/0301connect_oit`. Make sure you are login as root.
2. Enter the database docker container with the following command.
    ```
    docker exec -it spatempdb bash
    ```
3. Backup the database with the following command when you are in the container. You will see a list of errors. Ignore the errors it is expected.
    ```
    pg_dump -U chaos -Fc -f backup.bak spatempdb
    ```
4. Exit the container. By typing 'exit'.

5. Copy the backup file from the docker container using this command.
    ```
    docker cp spatempdb:backup.bak .
    ```
6. Copy the backup file to your own app folder.
    ```
    cp backup.bak /app/$YOUR_APP_FOLDER/backup/backup20211210.bak
    ```
7. On your laptop, open up a new terminal. Using the scp command copy the backup file onto your own computer current directory.
    ```
    scp YOURLOGIN@andlchaos300l.princeton.edu:/app/YOUR_APP_FOLDER/backup/backupYYYYMMDD.bak .
    ```

8.  Then upload the backup file to the chaos google drive folder. CHAOS Research -> frost_server_backup

9. You can then restore the database following these instructions <a href="https://chenkianwee.github.io/masa3db/docs/040/0411maintain.html" target="_blank">here</a>

## Server Down - Docker Restart Issue
1. Make sure you are logged in as root. Then use this command to start Docker
    ```
    systemctl start docker
    ```
2. Start all the containers with the following command.
    ```
    docker start spatempdb
    docker start frost
    docker start grafana
    ```

## Renew SSL Certificate
We  got our SSL certificate (enable the https url) from the Princeton OIT. We need to renew it every year. When the certificate is expiring, whoever got it setup the last time will get a warning message. Follow the instructions below to renew the certificate.
1. ssh into the Princeton OIT server and get root access as shown in this {doc}`../030/0301connect_oit`.
2. Interactive bash into the container running the FROST-Server with the following command
    ```
    docker exec -it -u root frost bash
    ```
3. You will be logged into the container as root with the -u 0 option. Generate a keystore with the following command.
    ```
    keytool -genkey -alias andlchaos300l -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore andlchaos300l.jks
    ```
4. You will be prompted to fill in the following parameters. Remember your keystore password. The .jks file will be generated in the directory.
    ```
    Enter keystore password:
    Re-enter new password:
    What is your first and last name?
      [Unknown]: andlchaos300l.princeton.edu
    What is the name of your organizational unit?
      [Unknown]: OIT
    What is the name of your organization?
      [Unknown]: Princeton University
    What is the name of your City or Locality?
      [Unknown]:  Princeton
    What is the name of your State or Province?
      [Unknown]:  New Jersey
    What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
      [Unknown]:  US
    Is CN=andlchaos300l.xyz.com, OU=your_unit, O=your organization, L=Princeton, ST=New Jersey, C=US correct?
      [no]:  yes
    ```
5. Generate the CSR file to be signed with this command.
    ```
    keytool -certreq -alias andlchaos300l -keystore andlchaos300l.jks -file andlchaos300l.csr
    ```
6. To read the generated 2048 key generated use the following command.
    ```
    cat andlchaos300l.csr
    ```
7. Copy and paste the certificate into the request form <a href="https://princeton.service-now.com/service?id=kb_article&sys_id=b22a27064f9ca20018ddd48e5210c777" target="_blank">here</a>.
    - Copy the code with the begin certificate and end certificate line.
    - This is not a SAN certificate so just keep it as NO.
8. Usually within a day Princeton OIT will get back to you with the signed certificates. Download the PKCS#7(.p7b) certificate. Copy the certificate to the Princeton OIT server.
    ```
    scp C:\directory_of_where_you_download_the_cert\andlchaos300l_princeton_edu.p7b yourid@andlchaos300l.princeton.edu:/app/yourid
    ```
9. Once you have moved the cert onto the server. You need to put it into the frost container to be installed. Make sure you are logged in as root so you can copy the file into the docker container frost.
    ```
    docker cp andlchaos300l_princeton_edu.p7b frost:/usr/local/tomcat
    ```
10. Bash into the frost container with the following command.
    ```
    docker exec -it -u root frost bash
    ```
11. Import the .p7b file using the following command
    ```
    keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias andlchaos300l -keystore andlchaos300l.jks -file andlchaos300l_princeton_edu.p7b
    ```
12. You can checked the installed certificate with this command.
    ```
    keytool -list -v -keystore andlchaos300l.jks -storepass $yourpassword
    ```
    - You can delete the certificate with this command.
        ```
        $ keytool -delete -alias andlchaos300l -keystore andlchaos300l.jks -storepass $password
        ```
13. If the jks filename is 'andlchaos300l' and you did not change the password of the keystore. Just restart the container and the new certificate will be installed. If not we will have to edit the edit the setting in Tomcat. Open the server.xml file at the conf directory. Look for this segment and make changes to the kerystore file and keystore pass as accordingly.
    ```
    <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
            connectionTimeout="20000"
            redirectPort="8443"
            SSLEnabled="true"
            scheme="https"
            keystoreFile="keystorefile.jks"
            keystorePass="keystore_password"
            clientAuth="false"
            sslProtocol="TLS"/>
    ```
14. Exit the container by typing exit and Restart the container with the following docker command.
    ```
    docker restart frost
    ```
15. Go to https://andlchaos300l.princeton.edu:8080/FROST-Server to make sure everything is working.

### Install the certificate in Grafana
The instruction here is based on this [post](https://community.grafana.com/t/grafana-https-configuration/524)

1. Log into the OIT server as a root user {doc}`../030/0301connect_oit`. Export the certificate and private key from the keytool (I have assumed you are using keytool from the frost server container). I assumed you have imported all the signed certificates into the keystore. You can then run this command to export the cert.pem (signed certificate) and key.pem (private key) for use in the granfana server. Instructions here are based on this [post](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/3779/how-can-i-export-my-private-key-from-a-java-keytool-keystore)
    ```
    keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore andlchaos300l.jks -destkeystore andlchaos300l.p12 -deststoretype PKCS12 -srcalias andlchaos300l -deststorepass $your_password -destkeypass $your_password
    ```

2. Once you $keystore.p12 is created. Use openssl to export the certificate with this command.
    ```
    openssl pkcs12 -in andlchaos300l.p12 -nokeys -out cert.pem
    ```

3. Generate the private key with this command.
    ```
    openssl pkcs12 -in andlchaos300l.p12 -nodes -nocerts -out key.pem
    ```
4. Once you have both the key.pem and cert.pem. Copy the two pem files out of the frost container.
    ```
    docker cp frost:usr/local/tomcat/cert.pem /app/$yourid/cert.pem
    docker cp frost:usr/local/tomcat/key.pem /app/$yourid/key.pem
    ```
5. Copy the two pem files into the Grafana container.
    ```
    docker cp /app/$yourid/cert.pem grafana:/etc/grafana

    docker cp /app/$yourid/key.pem grafana:/etc/grafana
    ```

6. Go into the Grafana container go to the directory /etc/grafana. These instructions are based on this [post](https://medium.com/grafana-tutorials/adding-ssl-to-grafana-eb4ab634e43f)
    ```
    docker exec -it -u root grafana bash
    ```

    a. Change the permission of the files to allow Grafana to read them.
    ```
    chmod 640 /etc/grafana/cert.pem
    chmod 640 /etc/grafana/key.pem
    ```

    b. using Vim, open the file 'grafana.ini'
    ```
    vi grafana.ini
    ```

    c. Uncomment (remove the ; infront of the line) and make the following changes to the grafana.ini file.
    ```
    [server]
    protocol = https
    cert_file = /etc/grafana/cert.pem
    cert_key = /etc/grafana/key.pem
    ```
7. Once all this is done. Restart the Grafana container.
    ```
    sudo docker restart grafana
    ```
8. Visit https://andlchaos300l.princeton.edu:3000 to make sure grafana is still working.
