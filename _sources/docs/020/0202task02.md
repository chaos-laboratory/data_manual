# Get Data from Desigo and Post to FROST-Server

In this example, we are getting the flow rate from a flow sensor in Desigo and then posting it to our FROST-Server.

- **This example assumes you know how to run a Python script.**

1. Register a new Thing on our FROST-Server with a datastream using Python. This Thing will receive the data coming from Desigo.
    </Br><Br/>
    a. Download the Python script, 'sensorthings_reg_thing_ds.py' from [https://github.com/chaos-laboratory/sensorthingsAPIeg](https://github.com/chaos-laboratory/sensorthingsAPIeg). Under the code tab you can download all the codes as a zip file.
    </Br><Br/>
    b. In the script, 'sensorthings_reg_thing_ds.py',fill in the parameters with these values, approach a lab member to get the login credentials:
    ```
    #THING PARAMETERS
    thing_name = 'B70_COND_FLOW'
    thingDesc = 'The flow of condensate from Chem to Arch Lab'#describe the deployment
    pins = ''#describe the pins connection on the particle device

    #LOCATION PARAMETERS
    locName = 'Arch Lab'
    locDesc = 'Mech room in Arch Lab'
    loc_encoding_type = 'application/vnd.geo+json'
    #Define the geometry of the location. Geometry types from geojson is accepted. Refer to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946 for geometry types.
    loc_type = 'Point'
    coordinates = [-74.649933,40.343601,0] #0,0,0 lon/kat/alt is the coordinates of null island, this is just a place holder

    #DATASTREAM PARAMETERS
    ds_name = 'condensate flow'
    ds_desc = 'the flow of condensate from chem to Arch Lab'
    obs_type = 'http://www.opengis.net/def/observationType/OGC-OM/2.0/OM_Measurement'
    ds_uom = {"name": "gallons per minute",
              "symbol": "gal/min",
              "definition": "http://www.qudt.org/qudt/owl/1.0.0/unit/Instances.html#GallonUSPerMinute"}

    ds_obs_prop_id = 4
    ds_sensor_id = 4
    ```
    c. Run the script and a new thing will be created. Take note of the ID Stream as you will need the ID for the next step.
    ```{figure} /_static/0202task02/reg_thing.png
    :width: 100%
    :name: reg_thing

    Result from the post
    ```
2. Go to the google drive folder: 'CHAOS Research/Campus as a Lab Research and Documentation/Facilities Siemens Desigo REST API'. Download the 'desigo2frost.py' script. fill in the parameters with these values, approach a lab member to get the login credentials. In this example we are pulling data from a flow meter.
    </Br><Br/>
    a. The script will only work if you are VPN into the Princeton Network or you are using Princeton Wifi.
    ```
    ds_id = 8 #the datastream ID to post to

    token_path = 'C:\\token.json' # file path to store the access token on you local computer
    freq = 1 # the frequency of get request, seconds

    #Information about which point to pull from Desigo. Refer to the FAC-RDS-202w.RDP Insight software to find the respective points to retrieve data.

    system_info = 'System1.ManagementView:ManagementView.FieldNetworks.Architecture_Lab.Hardware.'
    field_panel = 'mec-cscs-apog417.Local_IO.'
    pt_name = 'B70_COND_FLOW;'
    ```
3. To visualize the data in Grafana, follow the instruction from {doc}`../030/0319subtask19`. Look for the Thing and Datastream created in this exercise.
