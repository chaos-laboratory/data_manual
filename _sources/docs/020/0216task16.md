# Plug and Sense
We keep a box of ready-to-go sensors in the lab. They are stored in a box labelled 'plug n sense'. The particle devices are connected to the 'servicenet' wifi network on Princeton campus. The box is kept above the soldering station as shown in the image.

2. Plug the sensor in and the sensor will start sensing.
3. Refer to  {doc}`../030/0319subtask19` to visualize the data on Grafana.
